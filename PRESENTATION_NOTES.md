## Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Slide Title**: WEGUARD AI
- **Subtitle**: AI-Powered Fake Website & Phishing URL Detection
- **Motto**: *"Don't just detect the threat. Understand it."*
- **Spoken Content (~20s)**:
  > "Hello judges and fellow hackers. We are presenting WebGuard AI. In today's digital landscape, phishing remains the number one initial attack vector in cybersecurity. But traditional security tools either silently block links or display vague warnings. WebGuard AI takes a fundamentally different approach: we don't just detect the threat — we help users understand it."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: WebGuard AI combines multi-signal heuristic analysis, optional threat intelligence, and explainable feature-based AI into an accessible web app and browser extension.

## Slide 2: Problem Statement
- **Slide Title**: The Problem with Modern Phishing
- **Key Points**:
  - Phishing links are engineered to look trustworthy (typosquatting, look-alike domains, HTTPS certificates).
  - Users click suspicious links without understanding the underlying risk.
  - Traditional browser warnings act as black boxes without explaining *why* a site is suspicious.
  - Users need an understandable, actionable security assessment before trusting a link.
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "Phishing attacks have evolved far beyond obvious email typos. Today's attackers use punycode spoofing, disposable subdomains, and deceptive path structures that easily fool human eyes. Worse, modern browsers often show a simple 'Site Unsafe' warning without explaining what was actually detected. This leads to alert fatigue, ignored warnings, and credential theft."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Black-box warnings fail because they do not foster user security literacy or verify link structure transparently.

## Slide 3: Our Solution
- **Slide Title**: Our Solution — Detect + Explain + Protect
- **Key Points**:
  - **Detect**: Multi-signal risk assessment across 18 lexical and host indicators.
  - **Explain**: Plain-English threat explanations generated without external black-box LLMs.
  - **Protect**: Real-time browser extension workflow with actionable security recommendations.
  - Generates: Risk Score (0–100), Risk Tier, Indicator Badges, Threat Intel Status, Feature-Based AI Prediction, and Clear Action Guidance.
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "Our solution is WebGuard AI. We built a system around three pillars: Detect, Explain, and Protect. Instead of a binary safe-or-unsafe flag, WebGuard analyzes the URL across three independent layers, computes a transparent 0 to 100 Threat Score, highlights the exact structural indicators found, and gives plain-English recommendations on what the user should do."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Multi-layered defense-in-depth output (Score + Badges + Reasoning + Recommendations).

## Slide 4: How It Works
- **Slide Title**: 7-Stage Security Pipeline
- **Visual Flow**:
  ```
  User URL ➔ Validation & Sanitization ➔ Feature Extraction (18 attributes)
           ➔ Threat Intelligence Lookup ➔ Feature-Based Risk Prediction
           ➔ Multi-Signal Risk Engine ➔ Explanation Engine ➔ Threat Score & Recommendations
  ```
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "Here is how our pipeline works under the hood. When a URL is submitted, we first validate and sanitize it against malicious pseudo-protocols like javascript: or data:. We extract 18 lexical and structural features, query threat intelligence if configured, evaluate a hand-calibrated feature model, combine the signals mathematically, and generate a plain-English explanation."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Fully modular, deterministic 7-stage pipeline operating in under 15 milliseconds locally.

  ```
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "Our architecture is clean and decoupled. Users can interact via our React web application or directly through our Manifest V3 Chrome Extension. Both talk to a hardened Express API on the backend. The API executes the analysis pipeline and returns a unified JSON risk profile that renders dynamically in both the dashboard and extension popup."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Unified backend pipeline powers both web application and Chrome extension through identical API contracts.

---

## Slide 6: URL Features Checked
- **Slide Title**: 18 Structural & Lexical Indicators
- **Key Indicators Checked**:
  - **Protocol & Encryption**: HTTPS vs unencrypted HTTP.
  - **Host Characteristics**: IP-based address host, suspicious ports (8080, 8443).
  - **Lexical Complexity**: URL length, @ symbol credential embeds, character entropy.
  - **Domain Structure**: Subdomain depth, disposable domain TLDs (.xyz, .top, .tk).
  - **Deception Patterns**: Brand impersonation (PayPal, Apple, Google keywords in subdomains), Punycode / IDN homograph spoofing, URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl).
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "What exact features are we looking for? Our URL analyzer inspects 18 specific indicators: does the URL use an IP address instead of a domain? Is it using an unencrypted port? Does it have multiple nested subdomains pretending to be Apple or PayPal? Does it contain homograph punycode or obfuscated @ symbols? Every single indicator has a dedicated severity and weight."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: All 18 features are extracted in pure Node.js without third-party web scraping or DOM rendering.

## Slide 7: Risk Scoring System
- **Slide Title**: Transparent Multi-Signal Scoring
- **Score Tiers**:
  - **0–30 | LOW RISK (Emerald)**: Clean structural baseline; no significant threat heuristics.
  - **31–70 | SUSPICIOUS (Amber)**: Multiple anomalies detected; warrants caution before entering credentials.
  - **71–100 | HIGH RISK (Crimson)**: Critical phishing indicators or known malicious reputation detected.
- **Scoring Breakdown**:
  - Local URL Analysis Heuristics: Up to 60 pts
  - Threat Intelligence Reputation: Up to 25 pts
  - ML Feature Model Prediction: Up to 15 pts
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "Our Threat Score is scaled from 0 to 100. Scores up to 30 are Low Risk. From 31 to 70 is Suspicious, and 71 and above triggers a High Risk warning. When external threat intelligence is active, local heuristics contribute 60%, threat intelligence 25%, and feature prediction 15%. If threat intel is unavailable, local analysis scales automatically to preserve full dynamic range."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Strict, calibrated thresholds (`LOW ≤ 30`, `SUSPICIOUS 31–70`, `HIGH ≥ 71`) with dynamic weighting. No claim of absolute 100% safety guarantees.

## Slide 8: Explainable AI & Feature Prediction
- **Slide Title**: Explainability Over Black Boxes
- **Flow**: `Risk Score ➔ Indicators ➔ Plain-English Explanation ➔ Action Recommendation`
- **Key Distinction**:
  - Uses an **18-dimensional feature-based risk model** with hand-calibrated weights.
  - Deterministic natural language generation (NLG) engine constructs human-readable explanations.
  - Does NOT claim a trained deep-learning black box when none is present.
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "Notice how we handle AI. In cybersecurity, black-box AI that just outputs '92% phishing probability' is unhelpful to users and security analysts. WebGuard AI uses an explainable feature vector model. We map the extracted attributes into an 18-dimensional vector, score it transparently, and use an explanation engine to tell the user exactly which factors contributed to the score."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Transparent, auditable reasoning beats opaque confidence scores in cybersecurity awareness.

---

## Slide 9: Threat Intelligence & Fallback
- **Slide Title**: Real-World Threat Intelligence Integration
- **Integrations Supported**:
  - **VirusTotal v3**: Multi-engine antivirus & blacklist lookup.
  - **Google Safe Browsing v4**: Industry standard malicious URL database.
- **Reputation Signals**: Known Malicious | Suspicious | Clean | Provider Unavailable.
- **Honest Fallback**:
  - If API keys are unconfigured or rate-limited, WebGuard declares `"Local Analysis Mode"`.
  - External unavailability is **never** treated as evidence that a URL is safe or malicious.
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "We support real threat intelligence through VirusTotal and Google Safe Browsing. But here is where we prioritize technical honesty: if the keys aren't configured or the provider is offline, WebGuard clearly tells the user it is running in Local Analysis Mode. We never fake threat intelligence feeds or fabricate simulated antivirus detections."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Resilient fail-soft architecture that preserves heuristic analysis during external API outages.

## Slide 10: Chrome Extension Workflow
- **Slide Title**: Real-Time Browser Protection
- **Capabilities**:
  - Manifest V3 extension with background service worker.
  - Active tab inspection on user demand.
  - Real-time safety badge and risk score meter.
  - High-risk warning overlay with safe exit ("Go Back") and deep dive ("View Details").
  - Minimal permissions: only `activeTab`, `storage`, and `notifications`.
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "Users don't just want to copy-paste links into a website; they need protection while browsing. Our Chrome Extension allows instant analysis of the active tab. Built on Manifest V3 with minimal permissions, it alerts users before they enter credentials on suspicious sites and provides a one-click 'Go Back' safe exit."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Zero invasive DOM scraping or credential harvesting; strictly passive tab URL inspection.

## Slide 11: Cybersecurity Dashboard & Analytics
- **Slide Title**: User Activity & Security Insights
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Total URLs Analyzed
  - Low Risk vs. Suspicious vs. High Risk distribution
  - Average threat score
  - Historical scan timeline with instant re-scan
  - Filter chips and JSON export for security audit logs
- **Spoken Content (~20s)**:
  > "Our dashboard gives users and hackathon judges full visibility into scan history. You can review past scans, filter by risk tier, inspect the distribution of threats encountered, and export the analysis history for incident response review."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: 100% browser-local storage via `localStorage`; zero server-side telemetry or user tracking.

---

## Slide 12: Security & Privacy Safeguards
- **Slide Title**: Privacy-First, Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Safeguards Built-In**:
  - **Passive Inspection**: Links are never visited, rendered, or executed.
  - **Strict Protocol Filtering**: Rejection of `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`, and null-byte payloads.
  - **Zero Database**: No user passwords, payment cards, or cookies are ever captured.
  - **Server-Side Key Isolation**: Third-party API keys reside strictly in backend environment variables.
  - **Sliding-Window Rate Limiting**: 60 requests/minute per IP to prevent denial-of-service.
  - **Defensive HTTP Headers**: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "Security and privacy were designed into WebGuard AI from day one. We never visit or render target URLs, which protects both server and client from drive-by downloads. We collect zero passwords, cookies, or personal data. And our backend enforces strict rate limiting, 10KB payload caps, and defensive HTTP headers."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Complies with principle of least privilege and strict data minimization.

## Slide 13: Live Hackathon Demo Flow
- **Slide Title**: Live Interactive Demonstration
- **2-Minute Demo Steps**:
  1. **Clean Baseline**: Analyze `https://accounts.google.com` ➔ Shows **LOW RISK (Score: 0)**, emerald gauge.
  2. **Suspicious Scenario**: Analyze disposable domain clone ➔ Shows **SUSPICIOUS (Score: 40)**, amber gauge, flagged keywords.
  3. **High-Risk Phishing Trap**: Analyze synthetic IP credential harvesting trap ➔ Shows **HIGH RISK (Score: 86)**, crimson gauge, warning banner with "Go Back".
  4. **Analytics**: Switch to Dashboard to show updated metrics and distribution.
  5. **Extension**: Open Chrome Extension and analyze tab in real time.
- **Spoken Content (~30s)**:
  > "Let's demonstrate WebGuard AI in action. First, we enter a safe URL like Google Accounts — Low Risk, 0 score. Next, we run our suspicious scenario with a disposable domain — Suspicious, highlighting non-standard TLDs. Finally, our high-risk scenario — an IP-based PayPal spoof. The circular gauge pulses red at 86, the high-risk alert banner warns against credential entry, and the user is provided with a safe exit."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Reproducible, harmless test scenarios that demonstrate the full dynamic range of the engine.

## Slide 15: Future Scope & Roadmap
- **Slide Title**: Roadmap & Future Scope
- **Planned Enhancements**:
  - **Trained Machine Learning Model**: Train logistic regression / random forest on PhishTank and OpenPhish datasets and export to ONNX runtime.
  - **Visual & Favicon Homograph Matching**: Compare target favicon and logo hashes against legitimate brand repositories.
  - **Secure Headless Sandboxing**: Optional isolated server-side crawler to analyze post-redirect HTML title and form actions.
  - **Enterprise SIEM Integration**: Export scan telemetry via Webhooks to Splunk or Microsoft Sentinel.
- **Spoken Content (~25s)**:
  > "Looking forward, our roadmap includes training a production classifier on labeled PhishTank datasets and deploying it via the ONNX runtime in Node.js. We also plan to integrate visual favicon hash matching and optional sandboxed headless DOM rendering for enterprise environments."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Realistic, high-impact roadmap grounded in the existing feature vector foundation.

## Slide 16: Technical Limitations
- **Slide Title**: Technical Limitations & Honesty
- **Current Limitations**:
  - **No Guarantee**: Heuristic analysis evaluates structural probability, not absolute truth.
  - **Passive-Only**: Cannot inspect dynamic JavaScript redirects or post-login page contents.
  - **Third-Party Rate Limits**: Threat intelligence relies on provider API quotas.
  - **Browser Internal Schemes**: Extension cannot inspect `chrome://` or `about:blank` pages.
- **Spoken Content (~20s)**:
  > "To be technically honest: WebGuard AI evaluates the structural probability of phishing. It cannot guarantee that a clean-looking URL is 100% benign, nor can passive inspection catch compromised legitimate sites before they redirect. We believe stating these limitations clearly is essential for real cybersecurity credibility."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: Technical humility and realistic threat modeling build lasting security trust.

## Slide 17: Conclusion
- **Slide Title**: Conclusion — Understanding the Threat
- **Core Message**:
  - WebGuard AI transforms URL security from an opaque binary warning into an **understandable, actionable risk assessment**.
  - **Detect + Explain + Protect**.
- **Spoken Content (~20s)**:
  > "In conclusion, WebGuard AI bridges the gap between automated detection and human security awareness. By detecting the threat, explaining the reasons, and protecting the user at the browser level, we empower users to navigate the web safely. Thank you, and we are ready for your questions."
- **Key Technical Takeaway**: WebGuard AI is presentation-ready, deployment-ready, and verifiable end-to-end.
